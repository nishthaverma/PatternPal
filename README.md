<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
My vision for PatternPal is to be an all inclusive tool for organizing and managing knitting and crocheting patterns. I wanted to make the process of recording, storing and accessing patterns simpler. Right now, it's in the early stages, and is very individualized. I am working on adding functionality for users to be able to make their patterns public and accessible by other users. This would include adding user profiles and privacy settings. It allows users to create detailed notes for each project and upload a picture of the pattern. Right now, users can upload the pattern details as a pdf or image, but ultimately the goal is for them to be able to record it within the app rather than have to create a seperate document.
